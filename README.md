Druthers
=================

##Description

Druthers is a web app that helps groups of all sizes make decisions. Anyone can initiate a discussion and invite others to participate.  Participants can discuss, propose solutions, and vote on the solutions they like the best.  Druthers processes all participants' votes and provides the most preferred solution.  The Druthers algorithm relies on the Condorcet Method (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method).
